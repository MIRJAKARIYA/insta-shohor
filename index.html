                <h3 class="text-center mb-3">How does Javascript work?</h3>
                <p>Javascript is a client side interpreted scripting language which runs in the browser.In every browser there is a javascript engine that converts our raw javascript code into machine executable code or byte code.for example chrome-V8 engine,Firefox-Spider monkey,Internet explorer-Chakra.When we load javascript code in the browser,the javascript engine takes the code and passes it into the parser.Parser checks the code line by line searching for errors and if any error is found in any line then the javascript engine stops parsing immediately and throws error in the console.If the whole code is okay then the parser produces a data structure called AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) which contains a tree representation of the javascript code.Then the engine converts the javascript code from the AST into machine code or byte code by interpreting(executing the code line by line).Now the processor can understand the byte code and it runs the code.Chrome V8 engine also uses a special type of compiler called JIT(Just In Time) compiler which makes the interpreting process faster.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center mb-3">What does Javascript event loop do?</h3>
                <p>As javascript is a single threaded language that means it can execute only one statement at a single point in time so there are some special mechanisms like web API,callback queue and event loop process are provided to our web browsers to do some complex operations.Callstack holds all the function calls in our code.when a function is called it gets to the top of the callstack and gets executed.when execution is finished the function is removed from the call stack and the next function call gets to the top.when asynchronous functions are called such as xhr call,setTimeout(),setInterval() etc then they are dropped in the callback queue.Event loop continuously checks the callstack and if the call stack is completely empty then the event loop triggers the callback queue and then all the functions are put to the callstack one by one by their serial and gets executed.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center mb-3">What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
                <p>Local storage and session storage are browser APIs.These are generally used to store data in the clients browser.Unlike cookies the data which is stored in local storage or session storage isn't sent to the server in each HTTP request.Both local and session storage work almost in the same way but there are some minor differences between them.Defferences are shown below-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The storage capacity of local storage is relatively higher than the session storage.The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB and the storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.</li>
                    <li>The data in the local storage can be accessed from any window/tab of the browser but the data in the session storage can only be accessed from the same window/tab for which the data is stored.</li>
                    <li>The data in the local storage can only be deleted manually but the data in the session storage is deleted automatically when the window/tab or the browser is closed.</li>
                    <li>The data in the local storage survives both the refresh of the page and closing of the browser but the data in the session storage survives the refresh of the page but doesn't survives closing of the browser.</li>
                </ul>
